# project-specific-theme package

Sets specific theme for specific project.
Enable it and forget about changing themes everytime you shift to another project. Just hit toggle from **Packages->project-specific-theme->toggle** or **ctrl+alt+a** when atom open your project to change it to custom theme.

### Note: If you're using git add the 'theme.json' file in your project directory to '.gitignore' file manually.

### Note:Make sure only one instance of atom is running and close other projects before toggling this package. Otherwise, **all the project themes will be set to this theme**.
